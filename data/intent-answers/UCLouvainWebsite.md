<ul>
	<li>https://uclouvain.be: mainly to find information about courses, auditoriums and news</li>

</ul>

### uclouvain.be
#### what-ucl-website
**what is the website of UCLouvain?**

The official website of UCLouvain is https://uclouvain.be. You will find all the official information related to the university there.

### MyUCL
#### what-myucl-for
**what is my MyUCL account for?**

Your <i>myUCL</i> account is a global university account that will allow you access your personal virtual dashboard ("bureau virtuel" in French).
On this dashboard, you will notably be able to:
<ul>
	<li>Get different registration certificates</li>
	<li>Enrol to courses</li>
	<li>Register to exams</li>
	<li>Get your exam grades</li>
	<li>Get links to your email inbox, schedule and Moodle</li>
</ul>

For this account, you have an identifier called your "global identifier", and a password.

#### activate-myucl
**how do I get a myUCL account?**

You will get your myUCL account a few days after registering at the university: you will be sent an email with your global identifier and a temporary password.
You will then have to activate the account by directly going on UCLouvain webpages or by following the link you receive in the activation email. You can then simply follow the instructions that you are given and choose a personal password.

After the activation, you will be provided a student email address and your Moodle account. The password for all those accounts are the same as your personal password.

#### how-set-up-dashboard
**(how) can I set up my virtual dashboard?**

Your virtual dashboard can be customized as you please. <a href="https://youtu.be/VXjOczNTUqE">Here</a> is a video that shows how you can do that.

### Moodle
#### what-moodle
**what is Moodle (for)?**

<a href="https://moodleucl.uclouvain.be">Moodle</a> is an online course platform used by professors to give students information, documents, exercises and communication tools regarding their courses.
Each course taught in the university has its own Moodle page, but some professors don't use them (they'll tell you on their 1st lecture).

The access to most courses is private, meaning you have to register to the Moodle page (which may need to be accepted by the teacher) to be able to see the announces and documents of the course.

By the way, registering to a course on Moodle is not considered an offical registration by the university.

#### get-moodle-account
**how do I get a Moodle account?**

You don't need to sign in for a Moodle account by yourself.
Once you register in the university and activate your myUCL account, a Moodle account will be created for you.
You can then use your global identifier and password on Moodle.

#### how-find-course-moodle
**how do I find courses on Moodle?**

You can simply search for the course in the search bar that is at the top of your Moodle dashboard. It is usually more effective to search for the course code, e.g. LINGI2132 (removing the leading L might help, i.e. INGI2132 instead of LINGI2132).

If you don't find a course on Moodle, maybe the professor doesn't use one.

#### how-register-course-moodle
**how do I register to a course on Moodle?**

To register to a course on Moodle, you'll first need to find it. After following the link, you should see a button "Enrol to the course", which you can click to enrol. Some courses are protected by a password ("enrollment key") which should be given to you by the teacher on the 1st lecture.

For some courses, the teacher or an assistant will need to accept your enrolment request (it can take a few days).

#### how-unregister-course-moodle
**how do I unregister from a course on Moodle?**

Starting in 2018, it is not possible anymore to unregister from a course on Moodle except in September and January. During those months, an "unregister" link should be present on the Moodle page of the course (usually in the right-hand column).

While it is annoying to be register to a course you are not following, don't worry, it isn't an official registration.

### ADE - Online schedule
#### what-service-schedule
**what platform is used to make and show schedules at UCLouvain?**

UCLouvain uses <a href="https://horaire.uclouvain.be">ADE Web Direct Planning</a> to make and show schedules to students. While it doesn't provide a very good user experience, it is very efficient to make schedules with the least amount of scheduling conflicts for several tens of thousands of students, professors and assistants.

#### where-get-schedule
**where can I get access to my schedule?**

There are several ways to access your personal course schedule:
<ul>
	<li>Directly from your dashboard on https://uclouvain.be: there should be a link to your schedule ("horaire" in French)</li>
	<li>From <a href="https://horaire.uclouvain.be">ADE</a> itself: you can select courses using the left-hand menu</li>
	<li>From <a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/etudier/horaires.html">this webpage</a>: you can enter the codes of your courses separated by a comma and press "Ok", which will generate a schedule containing all those courses on ADE</li>
</ul>

#### what-password-ade
**what is the password to access ADE?**

The username and password to access the schedules on ADE change every year. If you are register in the university, you should have received an email at the beginning of the term with the username and password for the semester.

### Mail
#### do-i-get-email-address
**will I get an email address when registering?**

When your registration is accepted at UCLouvain and you activated your myUCL account, you will be provided a student email address. This address is usually formatted as "<i>first_name.last_name@student.uclouvain.be</i>" (unless someone with the same name as you has already registered).
Assistant, professors and employees usually have an address formatted as "<i>first_name.last_name@uclouvain.be</i>".

#### how-access-email-inbox
**how do I access my email address?**

You can access your email inbox <a href="https://portal.office.com/">here</a> or from your myUCL dashboard.
Use the login "<i>global_identifier@oasis.uclouvain.be</i>" and the password that is associated to your global identifier.

#### check-email-frequently
**how often should I check emails?**

Emails are used by the university, your faculty and some of your professors and assistants to reach you and provide you useful (and not-so-useful) information. You should consult your mail on a regular basis, depending on the number of emails you receive per week. A good idea would be to do it at least once a week.

#### can-i-use-other-email-address
**can I use another email address?**

Official emails will from the university, your faculty or your professors and assistants will always be sent to your student email address. If you need to send emails back to them, you are expected to do so with the same address, to ease organization and identification of students.

This being said, you are of course allowed to redirect all the emails you receive to another personal email inbox.

## Wifi
#### is-there-wifi-ucl
**can I have an Internet connection inside the university?**

UCLouvain provides an Internet connection for all students in university buildings, through a Wi-Fi network. This network is part of the <a href="https://www.eduroam.org/">eduroam convention</a>, which you might be familiar with.

#### how-connect-eduroam
**how can I connect to the eduroam network?**

To connect to the eduroam Wi-Fi network, you will need to use the following identifiers:
<ul>
	<li>identifier: "<i>global_identifier@wifi.uclouvain.be</i>"</li>
	<li>password: the password associated to your global identifier</li>
</ul>
