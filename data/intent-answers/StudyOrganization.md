#### important-courses

The importance of a course in your study is usually measured with the number of ECTS credits they represent.

### Registration
#### how-register-courses
**how do I register to courses?**

You can register to courses directly from your myUCL dashboard on uclouvain.be.
Erasmus students will be automatically registered to their courses once they submit their Learning Agreement, but should still check they are well registered.

Be careful, registering to a course on Moodle is not considered an official registration.

#### have-to-register
**do I have to register to courses?**

If you don't register to a course but follow it anyway, it will not be evaluated and won't appear on your Transcript of Records. If you register to a course but don't follow it, it will be graded as "Not Evaluated" (NE), meaning you didn't pass it.

#### what-learning-agreement
**what is a Learning Agreement?**

The Learning Agreement is a document stating which courses an Erasmus student will take. This document must be signed by their home school coordinator and submitted to UCLouvain before the second Friday at the start of the semester.

If you have a problem with your registrations or Learning Agreement, please contact your faculty's student coordinator.

## Majors, minors, options and specifications

The minor is the same thing but with a smaller part of your bachelor: you will thus be able to choose a major and a minor.
