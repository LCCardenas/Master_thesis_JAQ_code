### Definition
#### what-is-ects
**what is an ECTS?**

ECTS credits are the workload units to build your study programme.
They reflect the total amount of work necessary to pass a course or seminar, including individual study.
1 ECTS credit is a standard european measure that corresponds to about 25 to 30 hours of work.

You can find more information about ECTS credits on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System">the wikipedia page about it</a> or on <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/les-credits-ects.html">this page of the university website</a>.
