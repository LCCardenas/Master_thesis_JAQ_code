## Kinds of kots
### Kot meaning
#### kot-meaning
**what does "kot" mean?**

The word "kot" originates from a Dutch word which meant "junk room". It is used nowadays in all regions of Belgium to call student accommodations: flats where students have an individual room, but share the kitchen, living room and bathroom with other students.

In Louvain-la-Neuve, most kots belong to UCLouvain and are quite inexpensive. Some private owners and real estate agencies also rent accommodations. There are other possibilities of housing, such as hotels, youth hostels and airbnbs.

## First-last things to do
### When arriving
#### first-thing-to-do-kot
**what is the first thing I have to do when I arrive in my accommodation?**

When you first arrive into your kot, you should check the entry inventory which the Neighborhood Office should have provided with the keys. It states every furniture that should be present in the accommodation when you arrive and their condition. When you're leaving, the kot should be in the same condition as described on this inventory.

You will have to sign a document acknowledging the good reception of the keys and stating the kot is as described in the entry inventory.
If you have any remarks (e.g. about the condition of the place), you should fill in this document before 10 days elapsed.
You will finally have to give the Neighborhood Office this document back.

### When leaving
#### to-do-before-leaving-kot
**what do I have to do before leaving my accommodation?**

If you use a UCLouvain accommodation, there are several things you need to do.
At least 15 days before the end of your accommodation contract, you should go to your Neighborhood Office (Hocaille, Biéreau or Bruyères) to get an appointment for the exit inventory.

2 opening days before the end of the contract, you must have
<ul>
	<li>done the exit inventory</li>
	<li>given the keys back</li>
	<li>left the accommodation</li>
</ul>

If you had a privately owned kot or a kot belonging to a real estate agency, the process should be somewhat similar and should have been explained to you when you signed the contract.

#### no-exit-inventory
**what if I don't have an exit inventory appointment?**

If you don't make an appointment for the exit inventory, an outside expert will be in charge of the exit inventory, at your expense. This expense is a fixed amount.

## Rules
### Subletting
#### may-sublet
**am I allowed to sublet my accommodation?**

For UCLouvain kots, it is forbidden to sublet. The tenant must be the person who signed the lease agreement.
If another student wants to rent your kot, you have to end your contract and the other student has to sign a new one at the Housing Service.

### Deposit
#### what-deposit-for-kot
**what is the deposit for?**

When you sign your lease agreement for your accommodation, you will be asked to pay a "safety deposit" by bank transfer. This amount of money is a safety for landlords in the case a tenant damages provided furniture.
If you don't make problems (which is usually the case), this deposit will be refunded at the latest by December 31 after the end of your last contract.

For privately owned and real estate accommodation, this should be written in your contract but is usually not permitted.
