## Rules
#### when-exams
**when are exams organized?**

There are 3 exam sessions:
<ul>
	<li>in January</li>
	<li>in June</li>
	<li>in August/September, which is a session during which you can resit exams</li>
</ul>
The 2 first exam sessions are organized at the end of a quadrimester.

#### how-many-times-exams
**how many times can I take an exam?**

Every student can take an exam twice: once during the first exam organization (usually in January or June), and once during the retake session in August/September. Some faculty allow student in their first year of bachelor to take an exam on each exam session (thus 3 times). Exams you passed cannot be resit.

The same rules for other exams apply when resitting an exam.

If you don't pass the exam after all those sessions, you will have to take the course again next year, or contrive with your home university if you go back there next year.

#### rules-exams
**which exams am I allowed to take?**

To take an exam, you must be registered to the course. At some point in the year, you will then be asked to register to the exams of the course you're enrolled in.
If you want to drop an exam, you'll have to fill in a Drop Exam(s) Form. The courses you drop will be graded as "Not Evaluated" (NE).

If you have to return to your home university for academic reasons in January, you'll be allowed to take your exams from there.

Of course, it is forbidden to cheat or help someone cheat at an exam. Having an electronic device (e.g. a phone) in your pocket can be considered cheating. The punishment for cheaters varies on the context and can be simply getting a 0/20 grade at the exam they cheated on, up to being expelled from all Belgian universities.

You'll usually be asked to put your phone in your bag at the beginning of the exam.

Finally, you need to have your student card with you when you take an exam.

#### can-I-have-phone-exam
**can I have a phone during an exam?**

Having an electronic device in your pocket during an exam can be considered cheating. You will usually be asked to put your phone in your bag at the beginning of the exam.

#### what-if-cheat
**what happens if I cheat?**

Cheating isn't usually worth it.

#### take-exams-from-home-uni
**can I take my exams from my home university?**

If you have to return to your home university for academic reasons in January, you'll be allowed to take your exams from there. A proof from your home university will be required. These exams taken from abroad must take place on the same day and, when possible, at the same time as the UCLouvain examination.

#### take-exams-from-home
**can I take exams from home?**

Exams can be taken only from inside the university. You will be able to find the exact room for each exam on ADE. However, if you have to go back to your home university for academic reasons in January, you'll be allowed to take your exams from there.

UCLouvain supports an increasing number of MOOCs whose exams can be taken from anywhere if you have an internet connection. Most of the courses are not MOOCs however.

## Registration
#### how-to-register-exams

#### when-register-exams
**when do I register to exams?**

## Grading system

	<li>written exams</li>

The ECTS Transcript of Records is a document that exchange student receive at the end of their study period at UCLouvain and which reports the courses they passed and their grades. This allows credits to be transfered from UCLouvain to their home university.

#### when-transcript-of-records-sent
