# JAQ pairs intents-answers -- SmallTalk
Related to small talk; put here rather than using to one made by Dialogflow to be able to custom the training phrase.

For example, the sentence 'Hi, who are you?' was classified as greeting although that is not wrong this does not respond to the question. The only way to correct this missclassification was by adding our self intent.
 

## About the agent

#### who-are-you
**who are you ?**

My name is JAQ. I am a chatbot intended to answer (present and future) international students' questions. May I help you?

## Miscellaneous
#### I-know
**I know !**

Glad to hear you knew that. If I misunderstood, try rephrasing your question.

Here are some examples of questions I can answer: <i>how can I register</i>, <i>do I need a visa</i>, <i>can I have a phone with me during the exams</i>, etc.

#### my-name-is
**my name is X**

Nice to meet you! You should know that I am intended to give general information, I don't have access to students' registration files.

You can ask me questions such as: <i>are there welcome events</i>, <i>do I need a visa</i>, <i>what are ECTS credits</i>, etc.
