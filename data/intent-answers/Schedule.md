## Academic calendar
#### what-academic-calendar
**what is the typical organization of a year?**

In Belgium, the year starts in mid-September and ends in June and is divided into 2 terms: from mid-September to January and from February to June.

There are 3 exam sessions: in January, June and August/September. The 3rd one is only to resit exams that you failed or didn't pass.

There is a week of holidays at the end of January (after the exams) and 2 weeks during the Easter break in April or May. There are also no lectures in the summer from July to mid-September.

#### term-organization
**what is the organization of a term?**

A quadrimester is divided in 2 parts, sometimes separated by a few weeks of holidays or an evaluation week. Some courses are given during only one part of the term, while others are given during a whole term or a whole year.

A quadrimester ends with an exam session. Don't worry, you will always have a few weeks between the last lectures and the first exams to let you study.

## Schedule
#### typical-lecture-hours
**what are the typical hours in a student schedule?**

Faculties have the rights to organize lectures from 8:30am to 10:00pm. That being said, most faculties usually don't put lectures later than 6:15pm.

One lecture usually takes 2 hours. You have 15 minutes between consecutive courses to be able to change rooms. Typical time slots are:
<ul>
	<li>8:30am to 10:30am</li>
	<li>10:45am to 12:45am</li>
	<li>Lunch time from 12:45am to 2:00pm</li>
	<li>2:00pm to 4:00pm</li>
	<li>4:15:pm to 6:15pm</li>
	<li>6:30pm to 8:30pm</li>
</ul>

Student schedules are usually quite similar every week in a term.
