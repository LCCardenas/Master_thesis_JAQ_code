### History
#### history-ucl
**what is the history of UCLouvain?**

UCLouvain was founded on the 4th of December 1425 in the city of Leuven.
In 1516, Erasmus teaches there; in 1543, Vesalius and Mercator do.
UCLouvain is then a very important university in Europe for the centuries to come.

From 1797 to 1816, due to the French revolution, UCLouvain is forced to close down by the French Republic.
From 1911 to 1920, Georges Lemaître studies at UCLouvain, then teaches there from 1926 to 1966.

In 1968, the university splits into a Dutch-speaking part called the Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven (KUL), which stays in Leuven, and a French-speaking part called the Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL), which moves to the city of Louvain-la-Neuve that was built for that.
They are now 2 different universities that gladly collaborate together. Football tournaments are even organized between the two of them.

In 1974, Christian de Duve from UCLouvain receives a Nobel Prize for identifying the lysosome (1955) and the peroxisome (1965).

In 2011, KUL changes its name to KULeuven; in 2017, UCL changes its name to UCLouvain.
