## University enrollment
### Process
#### how-to-enrol-ucl
**how do I enrol at UCLouvain?**

- *student origin: EU*

  To register, you must first complete an online application form. This form is available starting on the 1st of December and the deadline to fill it in is August 31.
  When your online application is complete and your accompanying documents are received by the university, your file will be assessed and, if approved, the Enrolment Office will send you a registration authorisation.

  You can bypass the application procedure if you have a Belgian degree and directly start registering online.

  Once you registered into the university, you will need to register into your faculty and into the municipality you'll live in (thus certainly the City Hall of Louvain-la-Neuve).

  You can get more information in <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/inscriptions">this section</a>.

- *student origin: non-EU*

**what are the legal requirements to register to UCLouvain?**

To be allowed to register into UCLouvain, there are a certain number of legal requirements you have to fulfill. They are described on <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/inscriptions/admissio-requirements.html">this webpage</a>.
