## Student associations
### Introduction
#### what-student-associations
**are there student associations in Louvain-la-Neuve?**

There are lots of student associations in Louvain-la-Neuve, representing 4 different categories:
<ul>
	<li>student representation (in front of the directing instances of the university or the faculties), e.g. the Assemblée Générale des Étudiants de Louvain (AGL) or the Coordination Générale des Étudiants Internationaux (CGEI)</li>
	<li>"Kots à projets" where students with a collective project live in an accommodation together</li>
	<li>Regional groups, where students from a same region can get together and share their culture with other students</li>
	<li>Circles that gather students from the same faculty</li>
</ul>

All those associations are supported by UCLouvain which provides building and subsidies, and enforces a certain number of rules.

### AGL

The Assemblée Générale des étudiants de Louvain (AGL) is a student association in charge of representing, defending and informing students. The representation is done by elected students (with elections every year) in all directing instances of the university (administration board, academic board, etc).

It also offers several services to students such as room lending, subsidies, juridic advice, students project support, etc.
