**what is the cost of books?**

The annual cost of books, course materials and office supplies depends on course choice and year, and varies between €400 and €700. Plus, first-year bachelor’s degree students should anticipate additional set-up costs of approximately €100 (lab coat, testing equipment, etc).

Some of those costs may be reduced, thanks to second-hand books and course materials for example.
