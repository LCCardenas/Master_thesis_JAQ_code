- [Belgium study system](https://uclouvain.be/en/study/international-bachelor-master-doctorate.html)
	For starters, here’s what you need to know:

    At UCLouvain, as in all Belgian universities, academic courses are organised into three degree levels in accordance with the so-called ‘Bologna’ system: bachelor’s (three years) , master’s (two years) and doctorate. In addition, the advanced master’s (one year) is available to holders of a master’s degree.
    The main language of instruction is French, and the university offers some programmes and classes in English. You can also take classes to get your French up to speed. With some exceptions, a doctorate can be pursued entirely in English.
    The academic year begins in mid-September and ends at the end of June. Full-time students (those pursuing a full year of study or a degree) must begin their studies in September, whereas exchange students can begin in September or February and doctoral students at any time of year.
    Excepting certain programmes,tuition feesfor the 2018-19 academic year consist of the base fee (€835) plus fees applicable to students from countries outside the European Union. Specific fees apply to exchange and doctoral students.

	If you wonder what is the cost of living in Belgium,

	please consult the UCLouvain page detailing

	a one year living costs at UCLouvain.

	For more information, here is a video made by

	former exchange students explaining how housing goes at UCLouvain. **Video on the website**
	2. 
	The social situation of the student and of the student’s family, as well as his or her residential status (commuter/campus resident, Belgian/foreign), directly influences the cost of study. Several budget items must be taken into consideration.

	Finding the best deal

	Each year the Student Support Service publishes informational brochures on the cost of study and study grants. Download it here.
- [Books and materials](https://uclouvain.be/en/study/livres-et-materiel.html)
	The annual cost of books, course materials and office supplies varies, depending on course choice and year, between €400 and €700.

	In addition, first-year bachelor’s degree students should anticipate additional set-up costs of approximately €100 (lab coat, testing equipment, etc.), plus the cost of purchasing a computer, which on average is €600.

	A student’s subsequent years of study entail specific internship and dissertation costs.
	Here’s a tip

	Some costs may be reduced. Consult reference works at the faculty library or website in order to find second-hand books and course materials.
- [Food and living expenses](https://uclouvain.be/en/study/alimentation-et-vie-courante.html)
	To calculate a complete budget, students must consider the cost of food and other necessary items that are not specific to studying.

	Food costs for a student living in UCL housing are slightly higher than those for a student living in the family home.

	Generally, students take breakfast in their student or other on- or near-site housing, at the family home, at a café, etc.

	Lunch can be taken at University Restaurants, which offer several complete meal options, including a vegetarian menu, at very reasonable prices.

	There are also many private restaurant options in town, as well as supermarkets and take-out and delivery options.

	Generally, students should budget a minimum of €50 per week (not including the weekend) for food.
	Tips

	University restaurants offer a main dish for as low as €3.20.

	Many students get together to prepare their meals, thus reducing costs and maximising a sense of community.
- [Housing costs](https://uclouvain.be/en/study/logement.html)
	UCL offers housing at competitive prices. Monthly rent for basic student housing (excluding electricity) varies between €240 and €340, and requires a security deposit of between €150 et €???.

	First-year bachelor’s degree students have priority for UCL housing.

	Students of more modest means can apply for rent reduction (of €55 or €75/month) in accordance with certain academic and economic criteria. New students must apply to the Student Support Service (Service d’aide aux étudiants) no later than 1 July.

	Property agencies and private owners also offer housing, whose prices vary greatly.

	Complete information is available at the UCL Student Logistics and Housing Service.
- [Social life, culture and sports](https://uclouvain.be/en/study/vie-sociale-culturelle-et-sportive.html)
	The amount to budget of course varies widely according to personal preferences, but €37 to €50 per month is a reasonable estimate. For example, a student cinema ticket costs around €7, a theatre ticket €10 and an academic journal €6.

	Both Louvain-la-Neuve and Brussels are rich in possibilities for cultural appreciation and entertainment. It is up to each student to take advantage of them during their time at UCL.

	The Sport and Fitness Service provides access to many sport and fitness activities for only €50 per year.
	Good deals

	The €10 Carte culture (‘Culture Card’) provides free or low-cost access to many cultural activities.

	The €50 SPORT UCL card provides access to many sport and fitness activities and its cost is often reimbursed by Belgian health insurance funds.
