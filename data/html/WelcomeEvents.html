						The Erasmus Student Network section of Louvain-la-Neuve (ESN LLN) is a voluntary student organisation. Their mission is to help you make the most of your exchange in our university, town and country. They will be pleased to welcome you upon your arrival and help you with your administrative tasks.
						<br>
						They will also organise parties, visits, trips and other activities during your stay. To keep you updated, join their group Erasmus ESN LLN on Facebook. If you want to become a member of ESN, you can get an ESNcard at their office, which will provide you access to their activities, trips, parties and discounts in every city and every country where ESN exists (39 countries).
						<br>
						Two important things to know before your arrival :
						<br>
						    They offer a pick-up service at the train station of Louvain-la-Neuve and a buddy system. If you would like to be welcomed at the station when you arrive and/or you would like to have a local student as buddy who would help you during your stay, you can fill in the following form as soon as possible and at least 7 days before your arrival: Buddy form
