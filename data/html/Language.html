								Of course! (If you’re an ‘Erasmus+’ exchange student, you can even get a head start on improving your French before your programme begins, by taking online classes on the OLS platform – see next answer below).

After that, you can take classes at the UCLouvain Language Institute (Institut des langues vivantes, ILV) or improve your French via student organisations offering learning activities such as conversation groups, knowledge exchange, text correction, etc. Complete information on learning languages at UCLouvain.
