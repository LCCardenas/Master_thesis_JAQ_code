						Most of the housing managed by the University and private owners are communal apartments. The student lives in an individual room, but shares with other students the kitchen, the living room and the sanitary installations (shower and toilets). The room is equipped (wash-basin, bed, mattress, chair, table, cupboard and shelf space); The tenants must buy their bedding and cutlery themselves. Communal apartments have six, eight or ten tenants.
						<br>
						Studios generally have one living room, including a kitchen area and a shower. Apartments have up to four rooms.
						Housing possibilities
						<br>
						Living in a “kot” : “Kot” originally is a Dutch word meaning “junk room”. Nowadays it is used in all parts of Belgium for student flats. It consists of single bedrooms with common areas i.e. kitchen, living room, bathroom(s) /shower(s)and toilet(s). A “kot” can be pre-reserved in advance through the UCLouvain “Service des Logements” (UCLouvain Housing Service) or through real estate agencies or private owners. It gives you the possibility to live with Belgian students in a shared apartment. A UCLouvain kot is usually less expensive than other housing solutions (cost: 225 to 350 €/month). Most of the rooms are on campus or in the neighbourhood. Living in a kot means living with other students which helps the integration on campus. The cleaning service comes once a week and cleans all the surfaces of common rooms.

							    HOW DO I FIND HOUSING?
							    <br>
								UCLouvain is unique for having so many furnished student housing units. Many students live in shared flats (with individual bedrooms, kitchen, living room and communal bathrooms). If you would like to live in UCLouvain housing, you will be able to apply online via the Accommodation Office webpage. Private housing offers are also available on university campuses.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/practical-information.html">UCLouvain's web page</a>
							<p>
								For students:
								<br>
								    UCL Accommodation Office offers 5,725 university units (rooms in shared flats, studios, flats, and family apartments) on the Louvain-la-Neuve and Brussels Woluwe and Mons campuses, primarily for use by students.
								    Private property agencies (French)
								    Private landlords who rent out rooms or flats
								    Rental listings at www.student.be and www.kots.be 
								    The Findaroom application on Facebook, updated daily (enter ‘Findaroom’ in Facebook’s search engine).
								    <br>
								Those who arrive at Louvain-la-Neuve without having reserved accommodation are advised to check into private accommodation in the area (hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast, etc.).
								<br>
								For students, most accommodation managed by the university and private companies consist of shared flats: students have their own room but share a kitchen, living area and bathroom facilities (shower and toilets). Rooms are furnished (washbasin, bed, mattress, chair, desk, wardrobe and bookcase). Tenants must provide their own bed linen and crockery. Shared flats can accommodate six, eight or ten tenants. Average monthly rent for a room is €295. Studios and flats generally comprise one room with a kitchen area and shower. Apartments are available for students with families; they have between one and three bedrooms. Rents range from €295 to €990, depending on the type of accommodation and number of bedrooms.
								<br>
								UCL has also created the unique concept of theme-based shared flats (the so-called ‘kots à projet’), which involves students living in shared accommodation and working together on a social, cultural or sport-related project.
								<br>
								Students with a disability can benefit from adapted accommodation mainly through two options: a shared flat or an individual flat. Additionally, some students without a disability are keen to offer their help by renting accommodation to a student with a disability.
								<br>
								UCL accommodation is in high demand and it is recommended that students reserve it as far in advance as possible by contacting the Accommodation Office.
								<br>
								Lists of private accommodation is also available on the various university campuses.

								Syello:

								Vu l'importante proportion de koteurs au sein de la population étudiante, l'AGL a mis en place le Syello (Syndicat des étudiants locataires). Le Syello soutient et renseigne gratuitement les étudiants qui rencontrent des difficultés dans le cadre de leur contrat de bail (récupération de garantie locative, résiliation unilatérale du contrat de bail, insalubrité, etc).

								Toutes les informations sont disponibles sur le site www.syello.org
