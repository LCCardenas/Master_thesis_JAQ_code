								ECTS credits are the measuring units to build your programme.
								<br>
								They reflect the amount of work necessary to pass a particular learning activity (e.g. a course or a seminar) and are calculated taking into account the total time needed in order to achieve the desired learning outcomes, including the time spent in individual study.
								Being a standard European measure, ECTS credits will make it easier for your studies at UCLouvain to be recognized by your home university.

								Workload
								<br>
								An academic year at UCLouvain equals 60 ECTS. The normal workload at LSM is 30 ECTS per term, which represent 6 courses of 5 ECTS each.
								At UCLouvain, exchange students are expected to follow the workload of a UCLouvain full-time academic semester. However, the exact number of credits you have to take is set up by your home university. We usually allow exchange students to take French language courses (a basic one and its complementary) but these ones are not to be taken into consideration for ECTS workload requirements.
								<br>
								LSM courses are often worth 5 ECTS each, which corresponds to 30 contact hours per course. Contact hours are the number of hours of lectures for the course. Courses at LSM being given on 6 weeks, you will in most of the case have 5 hours per week of lectures. You need to be aware that, for each course, you will need several hours outside lectures to prepare the lectures or group works.
							</p>
							<p>
								LSM recommends a workload of 30 ECTS credits for one semester. The below ECTS rules are of application :
								<br>
							    The maximum workload per semester at LSM is 30 ECTS.
							    Regular exchange students minimum workload is 20 ECTS (besides language courses).
							    CEMS exchange students minimum workload is 25 ECTS (besides Block Seminar, seminars & language courses).

							<p>
								A standard academic year is equivalent to 60 ECTS credits. Depending on how long you will stay at UCLouvain, you must therefore, in general, make up a programme of 30 credits (one semester) or 60 credits (two semesters). The exact number of credits you need to take is set by your home university, depending on your individual learning path. However, at UCLouvain you will be expected to make up a programme sufficiently close to the workload of a typical full-time academic semester or year.
