								Academic calendar
								<br>
								For all students except PhD students, who can begin their programmes at any point during the year, and Erasmus students who can begin their programmes in either September or January/February, the academic year starts in mid-September and finishes and the end of June (thus a student can only start in September). Classes are spread over two terms: the first term starts in mid-September and finishes at the end of December, and is followed by an examination session spanning the first three weeks of January. The second term starts at the end of January and ends in mid-May. This is followed by an examination session throughout June. A third session is held in the second half of August and the first week of September so that students can resit exams they did not pass the first time.

								WHAT IS THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR?
								<br>
								The academic year is divided into two terms. The first begins mid-September and ends mid-December and is followed by an exam period in the first three weeks of January. The second term begins at the start of February and ends mid-May and is interrupted by the two-week Easter holiday. It is followed by an exam period in June. A third exam period takes place from mid-August to early September during which students can retake exams whose initial results were unsatisfactory. Consult the UCLouvain academic calendar.

						How is the semester organized ?
						<br>
						The semester is separated into 2 parts of 6 weeks long: part 1 & part 2.
						<br>
						All courses are given on a period of 6 weeks; thus, they are given in part 1 or in part 2:
						<br>
						    The courses from part 1 may end with an exam after the 6 weeks of lecture (on week 7) or may have the exam during the June exam session.
    						The courses in part 2 have automatically the exams scheduled during the June exam session.

						Schedule
						<br>
						The LSM course schedule (page only accessible for students with a UCLouvain ID access) is updated just before the beginning of each academic year.
						<br>
						You may use the UCLouvain schedule engine (link currently not available) to organize your stay.
						At the bottom of that page, you can enter your courses code separated by a comma in the field with title "Horaire d'un ou plusieurs cours spécifiques" (Schedule of one or more specific courses). You will be redirected to a timetable application (ADE) where you can see your courses schedule week by week.
						<br>
						Finding Information about Courses
						<br>
						    Using the list of courses offered at LSM
						    You can click on the code of the course and you will be redirected to the URL of the course description on UCLouvain website.
						    <br> 
						    Using the UCLouvain website "votre recherche"
						    By typing the course code or the title of the course you are looking for in the field « votre recherche » on the top right of the UCLouvain website, you will get a list of search results. Select the first description you find and make sure you have the last version by looking at the year mentioned in the URL. If not, change it manually to the academic year concerned.
						    <br>
						Before you finalize your selection, pay particular attention to some practical elements listed in the course description; such as the language of instruction, the term course is given (Q1 or Q2), the prerequisites.
