								3. Register with your commune
								<br>
								Registration with the commune is compulsory for stays of more than three months.
								<br>
								1. If you are not an EU national:
								<br>
								    Within eight days of your arrival in Belgium, you must begin the process of registering with the municipality, or commune, in which you reside. Report to the commune’s Foreigners Department (Service des Etrangers) with:
								        your identification card or passport and visa;
								        your accommodation lease;
								        one passport-type photo.
								    In the days that follow the police will visit you at your residence to verify your address. You will then return to the Foreigners Department with documents specified by your commune in order to complete the registration process, for which the commune will charge €18.
								    When the commune completes the registration process, it sends you a Registered Foreigner Certificate (Certificat d’Inscription au Registre des Etrangers).
								    <br>
								2. If you are an EU national:
								<br>
								    Within eight days of your arrival in Belgium, you must register with the local government administration of the commune in which you reside, by reporting to its Foreigners Department (Service des Etrangers) with documents specified by the commune, which will charge a fee. In the days that follow the police will visit you at your residence to verify your address.
								    When the commune completes the registration process, it sends you a Registered Foreigner Certificate (Certificat d’Inscription au Registre des Etrangers).

							<p>
								Non-European students' specifics:
								Visa application should be started soon enough as it may last up to 60 days to complete the full process.
								Note that :
							    Students with dual nationality (European & Non-European) will be considered by UCLouvain as European students.
							    ASP Student Visa (long term Visa) is compulsory in order to register at UCLouvain and at the City Hall.
							    Chinese students coming from China are EXEMPTED from the ASP Certificate by showing the APS Exemption Letter that the LSM sent to their home coordinator after their nomination.
							    In case you need to start your Visa application process before your UCLouvain account is activated, you can start it based on the LSM Acceptance Letter that should be specifically requested by your home coordinator to LSM.

								HOW DO I OBTAIN A STUDENT VISA FOR BELGIUM?
								<br/>
								You do not need a visa if you are a national of one of the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway or Switzerland. If you do need a visa, the Enrolment Office will provide you with a registration authorisation letter to add to the student visa application you submit to your Belgian embassy or consulate. In either case, all students must register with their commune of residence within eight days of arrival in Belgium. Complete information on Belgian visas.

								Immigration / Visa
								<br>
								For students, researchers and lecturers who are staying for more than three months:
								<br>
								    citizens of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway or Switzerland do not need a visa.
								    <br>
								    citizens of any other country have to apply for a visa at the home country’s Belgian embassy or consulate as soon as possible.
								    <br>
								Regardless of nationality, individuals who are staying for more than three months are required to register with the municipality (‘Administration communale’, often spoken of simply as the ‘commune’) of residence within eight days of arrival in Belgium. This registration is valid for one year (five years for EU nationals) and must be resubmitted for renewal one month prior to its expiration (details below under ‘When you arrive’).
								<br>
								Researchers and lecturers employed by UCL may also require a Belgian work permit (see ‘Work permit’ below).
								<br>
								More information is available at the home country’s Belgian embassy or consulate, the Belgian Immigration Office and the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

							    HOW DO I OBTAIN A STUDENT VISA FOR BELGIUM?
							    <br>
								If you are admitted to UCLouvain, the Enrolment Office will provide you with a registration authorisation letter to add to the student visa application file that you will submit to your Belgian embassy or consulate. If you are a national of one of the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway or Switzerland, you do not require a student visa but you must register with the commune where you reside in Belgium. More information is available at the ‘Visa for Belgium’ page of the Belgian Foreign Affairs website.

							<p>
								Select your "Mutuelle" in Belgium
								<br/>
								Joining a "Mutuelle" in Belgium means you will be reimbursed for part of your medical and dental fees, hospital fees, surgery, giving birth, etc. according to the tariff set for the various types of care provided.
								<br>
								You are free to decide which "Mutuelle" suits you best. Some "Mutuelles" are based on the campus :
								<br>
								    Partenamut, Traverse d'Esope, 11 - tel. 0032 10 24 72 08
								    Mutualité Chrétienne, Place de l’Université, 8 – tel. 0032 10 45 13 76
								<br>
								If you made your choice before arriving in Belgium, you can already subscribe online (if available). Otherwise, you will be able to do it once you arrived in Belgium.

							<p>
								Which health insurance for whom (more information on FAQ for international students)
								<br>
							    European students : The European health insurance card is accepted.
							    Non-European students : You must subscribe to a health insurance in your home country or become a member of a Mutuelle in Belgium (mutual insurance company) which will reimburse (in part or in full, depending on the type of care given) medical care and the cost of some medicine.
							    <br>
								Be aware that you must hand in a copy of your health insurance certificate (European health card or proof of a private insurance certificate) to finalize your UCLouvain registration.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/when-you-arrive.html">UCLouvain's web page</a>
							<p>
								Register with a health insurance agency
								<br>
								Students who are not EU citizens are required to register with a health insurance agency (‘mutuelle’), which partially covers the cost of care, drugs and hospitalisation. To find a nearby office, consult their websites:
								<br>
								    www.mutsoc.be or www.solidaris.be
								    www.mc.be
								    www.mloz.be
								    www.mutualites-neutres.be
								    www.ml.be
								    www.caami-hziv.fgov.be
								    <br>
								While registering with a mutuelle is not a requirement for EU citizen students, who must show proof of coverage in their home country and provide form E 111, E 109 or E 128, or for some grant-assisted students whose funding organisation provides partial coverage, the university nevertheless advises these students to register with a Belgian health insurance agency to complement their existing coverage. To do so, students must be enrolled at the university and present the specific certificate provided by the university for health agency registration.

							<p>
								Healthcare
								<br>
								Students, researchers and lecturers who are citizens of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland must apply for the European Health Insurance Card. This card is free and provides access to the same public healthcare (e.g. doctors, pharmacies, hospitals or treatment centres) enjoyed by Belgian residents. Charges for medical care are reimbursed by the home country immediately or after returning to the home country (depending of the home country). However, EU nationals may wish to join a Belgian health insurance scheme ("mutuelle") (see below) to make sure they benefit from all available services (for example, child supervision at home).
								<br>
								Students, researchers and lecturers who are citizens of any other country must join a health insurance scheme (the so-called ‘mutuelle’ or ‘mutualité’; French and Dutch only) as soon as possible after arrival. These schemes reimburse the cost of medical care (either in full or in part depending on the type of services provided) and some medications, and are run by a range of agencies – socialist, Christian, liberal and independent – any of which can be chosen. Non-compulsory ‘complementary’ health insurance, which covers some or all of the costs not reimbursed by compulsory health insurance, is also available.
								<br>
								International students and some visiting professors (for example, those participating in Erasmus + teaching assignments) often have to prove that they are covered by international health insurance.
								<br>
								International visitors who stay in Belgium for less than three months cannot join a Belgian health insurance scheme.

							<p>
								Insurance offered by the university
								<br>
								1. For students:
								<br>
								Students enrolled at UCL benefit from accident cover while pursuing academic activities (including when travelling between accommodation and the university, during study trips and internships, etc.) and third-party liability cover while they are pursuing academic activities. There is no coverage providing emergency assistance relating to any accidents that happen in Belgium (repatriation to home country in the event of an accident). This kind of insurance must be taken out privately.
								<br>
								Concerning exchange students, their home university should continue to insure them against accidents and against the consequences of third-party liability while they are pursuing academic activities. Therefore they should contact their university to find out the limitations of its insurance policies.

					<p>
						Students other than grant-assisted PhD students do not pay Belgian social security contributions but do need to take action regarding reimbursement of healthcare costs (see ‘Healthcare’ section).
						<br>
						The schemes covered by the social security system include:
						<br>
					    compulsory health and incapacity insurance, healthcare sector;<br>
					    compulsory health and incapacity insurance, benefits sector;<br>

					<p><a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/administrative-information.html">UCLouvain's web page</a></p>
					<p>
						As a general rule, students are exempt from having to obtain a work permit, but there are two exceptions for students from non-EU countries: students who wish either to pursue a paid internship or to work while studying must obtain a Type C work permit.
						<br>
						More information is available at the ‘Foreign students’ page of the Belgian Federal Public Service for Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue (French), the federal website ‘Student at Work’ and the UCL Jobs Service.
						<br>
						Type B work permits are valid for maximum one year and must be renewed each subsequent year. More information is available at the ‘Work permit’ intranet page: https://intranet.uclouvain.be/fr/myucl/travailler/informations-legales-permis-de-travail.html

					<p>
						If they stay more than three months, students, researchers and lecturers should open a bank account as soon as possible after arrival. In fact, before leaving their home country, they should ask their bank whether it has a local counterpart in Belgium, which is likely and might be advantageous. As opening an account can take several days (see ‘Open a bank account’ in the ‘When you arrive’ section), arriving with sufficient funds in cash is necessary. More information in the "When you arrive" section.

						Getting around Belgium
						<br>
						Public transport
						<br>
						The Belgian National Railways offers discounts for adults under 26. Children under six ride free (up to four per adult), those aged six to eleven ride at half-price. Other discounts and passes are available, such as the Railpass, which is good for ten trips within Belgium over one year, and the Benelux pass, which allows unlimited travel on any five days within one month of purchase in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Attention: the Eurail Benelux Pass is valid only for non-European residents; the Interrail Benelux Pass is valid only for European residents.
						<br>
						TEC is the regional bus service for Wallonia and De Lijn is the regional bus service for Flanders; both offer service to, from and in Brussels. De Lijn also operates trams, including the Kusttram which operates along the Belgian coast. For public transport in Brussels (metro, bus and tram), consult STIB-MIVB as well as information on the Brussels public transport system’s MOBIB electronic card, which can also be loaded with ticketing for Belgian rail, TEC or De Lijn.
						<br>
						Passengers must indicate they intend to board approaching buses and trams by signalling the driver with a simple raise of the hand, otherwise they mightmay not stop.
						<br>
						By taxi
						<br>
						All major towns have taxi services, but they are quite expensive. They can rarely be hailed from the roadside; taxi stands are located at strategic locations, such as central squares and train stations. They can also be booked by phone and online. Drivers often do not have detailed knowledge, so passengers should be prepared to explain. As fares include service, tipping is not necessary, though rounding up is a frequent practice.
						<br>
						Brussels taxi companies
						<br>
						    Taxis Bleus
						    Taxis Verts
						    Autolux
						    <br>
						Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve
						<br>
						    Taxis Blancs
						    <br>
						Uber is also available in Belgium.
						<br>
						By bicycle
						<br>
						Overall, Belgium takes cycling seriously and is continually adding lanes and paths. Cyclists must know the rules of the road (see our sister university KULeuven’s helpful guide) and be particularly aware that traffic approaching from the right has right of way. Equipment can be rented in most towns and/or train stations for a reasonable price. Automated bike sharing networks include the Blue Bike nationwide network, Villo! in Brussels, La Bia Velo in Namur and Velo Antwerpen in Antwerp. Cyclists can even bring their bikes on trains or rent bikes as part of the train ticket price.
						<br>
						-------------------------
						Driving in Belgium
						<br>
						Belgium has a dense network of motorways, none of which are tolled. Road conditions are excellent, service stations are plentiful. Traffic congestion in Brussels can be heavy. Signs can sometimes be unclear and on secondary roads even absent. Road signs are in Dutch in Flanders and in French in Wallonia.
						<br>
						The minimum age for renting a car is 21; one year’s driving experience and a credit card are required. All major car rental agencies are available at airports and major train stations, across cities and in towns, Avis, Budget, Europcar, Hertz, etc.
						<br>
						Driver’s licence
						<br>
						Drivers must have a valid license and carry it while driving. The minimum driving age is 18.
						<br>
						Licences issued by an EU or EEA country are recognised throughout the EU.
						<br>
						Some licences issued by non-EU/EEA countries may be valid for short-term stays up to three months; others may be valid for short-term stays up to six months but only in conjunction with an International Driver’s Permit issued by national automobile associations (for country-specific requirements, check with the embassy or consulate in Belgium). For longer stays, licences issued by non-EU/EEA countries that have a licence exchange agreement with Belgium can be exchanged for a Belgian licence upon registering with the commune of residence. Otherwise, a Belgian licence must be acquired by taking both written and practical driving tests; it is possible to benefit from an interpreter when taking the written exam.
						<br>
						Rules of the road
						<br>
						Traffic drives on the right. Speed limits in urban areas are 50 kph (30 mph), on motorways 120 kph (75 mph) and 90 kph (55 mph) on other national roads. Unless intersections are otherwise marked, drivers coming from the right (and turning to the right) have priority and may proceed without stopping. Buses and trams always have priority.
						<br>
						Third-party insurance is essential and comprehensive insurance is highly recommended. Wearing safety belts is mandatory and no child under 12 can sit in the front passenger seat if back seats are available. Drink-driving is illegal and severely punished. Mobile phone use while driving must be hands-free.
						<br>
						Motorcycle drivers and passengers must wear gloves, a jacket with long sleeves, long trousers, and boots that protect the ankles. Children under three are not allowed on motorcycles. Children between three and eight can be passengers only on motorcycles up to 125cc and must be carried in a special child’s seat.
						<br>
						More complete information is available in the Belgian Highway Code (French and Dutch) and various English guides online.

						Telephone / Internet
						<br>
						There are three main mobile phone service providers:
						<br>
						    Proximus
						    Orange
						    Telenet-Base
						    <br>
						Each company offers a range of services and packages. Tariffs and conditions should be compared prior to entering into a contract, which can be obtained by visiting the nearest shop with:
						<br>
						    ID (passport or identity card);
						    proof of address (a utility bill, property rental contract or bank statement);
						    bank account IBAN number.
						    <br>
						Mobile deals can be fixed contract, rechargeable or pay as you go.
						<br>
						Several companies offer landlines either individually or as part of package deals that combine landline, internet, television and/or mobile service:
						<br>
						    Proximus
						    Telenet
						    VOO
						    Scarlet

						<br>
						Postal Services
						<br>
						The Belgian postal service, bpost, operates post offices Monday to Friday from 8:30 or 9:00 am to 4:00 or 5:00 pm. Some are open late Fridays and Saturday mornings. Increasingly, however, supermarkets and press shops also offer postal services. Public mail boxes are red.

						Over 95% of Belgian households have cable television. The main cable network operators in the Brussels Region and Wallonia are Proximus,  VOO, Telenet and Scarlet . They offer package deals that can include television, internet, landline and/or mobile services. There are no national television channels in Belgium. The two main public networks are and RTBF in the French Community (Wallonia and Brussels) and VRT in the Flemish Community (Flanders and Brussels)
						<br>
						Most cable, satellite and IPTV platforms in Belgium distribute stations from other European countries including the Netherlands, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy (NPO 1, NPO 2, NPO 3, ARD, ZDF, BBC One, BBC Two, BBC World News, BBC Entertainment, TF1, France 2, France 3, Rai 1). RTBF channels include La Une, La Deux and La Trois. The private RTL Group runs the French-language channels RTL-TVI, Club RTL and Plug RTL. La Une and RTL-TVI are the main channels with local newscasts and the most local programming.

					<p><a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/practical-information.html">UCLouvain's web page</a></p>
					<p>
						Recycling is important in Belgium. Rubbish is sorted at the source – in other words, in the household – into specific coloured sacks that must be purchased at local supermarkets, or into similarly coloured bins (depending on accommodation). Rubbish crews collect the sacks from the curb or trash bin outside residences on specific days – leaving rubbish out on the wrong day is subject to a fine.
						<br>
						The three basic categories of waste are:
						<br>
						    Paper and cardboard
						    Plastic, metal, aluminium-lined cartons (e.g. milk) (often in blue sacks)
						    Non-recyclable waste (often in white sacks)
						    <br>
						Recyclable glass is taken by residents to one of the many public bins for clear and coloured glass found throughout every commune. Throwing out recyclable glass in the white or any other sack can be subject to a fine.
						<br>
						Depending on the commune, additional sorting collection may be available:
						<br>
						    Food waste/compost
						    Garden waste
						    <br>
						Bebat offers collection points to recycle batteries.
						<br>
						For specifics about what exactly can and cannot be recycled, visit Fostplus, which also includes an interactive collection calendar. Alternatively for collection days, check with the commune, whose website will also offer more information on recycling electronics and batteries, collecting bulky items, and much else.

						Doctors, Hospitals and Pharmacies
						<br>
						Belgium’s health service functions well. Financed by the state and national and private insurance, its many hospitals are modern, well managed and offer high-quality care and treatment. Bills are paid immediately (for insurance, see ‘Healthcare’ in 'Administrative information' section). Healthcare related to hospital admissions are billed directly to the health insurance funds and the patient is only billed for the patient’s contribution. Pharmacists are highly professional and an excellent resource for advice and remedies for minor aches and pains. Pharmacies are generally open 9am to 6pm Monday through Friday, and increasingly Saturday mornings, and particular pharmacies (pharmacies de garde) are open nights and weekends.
						<br>
						Your GP is the first person to contact if you are ill. He or she is interested in the health of the whole person, and will provide treatment, offer personalised advice and may refer you to a specialist if needed. You can contact a GP at any time, even at night and at the weekend, using the organised on-call system. On-call medical doctors (médecins de garde) are available for non-emergencies; contact information is available on commune websites, e.g. Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve (02 38 50 500). Options in Brussels include La Garde Bruxelloise and SOS Médecins.
						<br>
						At some point in the future, dialling 1733 anywhere in Belgium will connect callers to the nearest on-call doctor.

						Childcare
						<br>
						In the French Community of Belgium, the Office of Birth and Childhood (ONE) is responsible for organising care for children aged three and under. There are various types of childcare facilities, but their number is limited. Therefore, one should take the time to search for the right facility. In practice, registering a future child can be done beginning with the fourth month of pregnancy.
						<br>
						The cost of childcare varies based on the type of facility but all costs are tax deductible. Thus a childcare facility subsidised by ONE offers prices proportional to the parents’ income, whereas other facilities set their own prices. More information on childcare facilities in the French Community of Belgium can be found at the ONE website.

						The University of Louvain has two nurseries. Both are located in Louvain-la-Neuve:
						<br>
						    Pomme d’happy welcomes around 24 infants.
						    Le P'tit Matelot (tel: 00 32 (0) 10 47 88 67)receives children if something unexpected comes up, if someone is needed to watch over a child for a few hours, or if childcare is required on a regular basis or for extended periods of time.

						<br>
						Schools
						<br>
						Compulsory education, which applies from the age of six to 18, is free in Belgium. The choice of institution is left to the parents. There is a wide range of secondary schools: collèges, instituts, lycées, athénées, etc.
						<br>
						Education is organised based on the following schema:
						<br>
						    Fundamental education: preschool begins at age 2½ and continues for three years; elementary school begins at age six and continues for six years.
						    Secondary education: six years split into three two-year cycles.
						    <br>
						There are two networks of subsidised education: the official network (state schools) and the open network (religiously or non-religiously affiliated schools). The cost of attendance is limited to school expenses such as books, photocopies and regular outings. For details (and a list of the region’s schools), go to www.enseignement.be.
						<br>
						A third network is private – not subsidised by the government – and therefore requires the payment of school fees. For European schools, visit the Schola Europaea website. A list of international schools in Belgium can be found at the website of the Educational Collaborative for International Schools (ECIS).
						<br>
						Louvain-la-Neuve hosts numerous primary and secondary schools in the two subsidised networks. These schools and their contact information are available at the official website of Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, and in the ‘Guide des commerces et services de Louvain-la-Neuve’ available both at the Student Support Service (‘Point de repère’) and at the Inforville counter near the train station ticket windows.
						<br>
						For other communes, consult their websites for school lists.

							<p>
								For starters, here’s what you need to know:
								<br>
							    At UCLouvain, as in all Belgian universities, academic courses are organised into three degree levels in accordance with the so-called ‘Bologna’ system: bachelor’s (three years) , master’s (two years) and doctorate. In addition, the advanced master’s (one year) is available to holders of a master’s degree.
							    The main language of instruction is French, and the university offers some programmes and classes in English. You can also take classes to get your French up to speed. With some exceptions, a doctorate can be pursued entirely in English.
							    The academic year begins in mid-September and ends at the end of June. Full-time students (those pursuing a full year of study or a degree) must begin their studies in September, whereas exchange students can begin in September or February and doctoral students at any time of year.
							    Excepting certain programmes,tuition feesfor the 2018-19 academic year consist of the base fee (€835) plus fees applicable to students from countries outside the European Union. Specific fees apply to exchange and doctoral students.

								please consult the UCLouvain page detailing

								a one year living costs at UCLouvain.

						<li><a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/combien-coute-une-annee-d-rsquo-etude.html">UCLouvain's web page</a>
							<p>
								The social situation of the student and of the student’s family, as well as his or her residential status (commuter/campus resident, Belgian/foreign), directly influences the cost of study. Several budget items must be taken into consideration.
								<br>
								Finding the best deal
								<br>
								Each year the Student Support Service publishes informational brochures on the cost of study and study grants. Download it here.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/questions-frequemment-posees.html">UCLouvain's web page</a>
							<p>
								HOW MUCH SHOULD I BUDGET?
								<br>
								A single student should budget approximately €10,000 per year (not including tuition and registration fees). For a family, add an additional €3,000 per person. These estimates are intended to cover settling-in, housing, food, transport, medical care and entertainment.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/practical-information.html">UCLouvain's web page</a>
							<p>
								Naturally, planning a budget depends on specific situations. Generally speaking, a single person should plan on an annual budget of approximately €9,500. Families and shared households should assume an additional budget of at least €3,000 for each extra person.
								<br>
								Accommodation costs are the greatest expense. Average monthly rent for UCL accommodation (a room) is €295. Average rent for privately owned accommodation is between €600 and €800 for a one-bedroom flat, and between €750 and €900 for a two-bedroom flat.
								<br>
								Other costs depend on lifestyle and use of university services (University Restaurants, certain university library services, sports facilities).
								<br>
								For students, a significant portion of these costs is due in September: enrolment fees, health insurance premiums, fees for most courses and syllabuses, first month’s rent, security deposit and initial accommodation costs. As a result, a minimum of €2,500 (excluding tuition fees) will be required in September. Thereafter, students must anticipate monthly rental payments and living expenses.
								Sample prices of everyday items:
								<br>
								    Train ticket from Brussels to Louvain-la-Neuve: €6
								    Daily newspaper: €1.50
								    Cinema ticket: €8
								    Private restaurant daily special: €10-13
								    Sandwich: €3.50
								    Loaf of bread (800 g): €2.10
								    250 g of chocolates: €6
								    1 kg of apples: €1.50-2.50
								    Litre of milk: €0.60-1
								    Package of ground coffee (250 g): €4-5
								    University Restaurant daily special: €4.75
								    <br>
								Paid employment and student status
								<br>
								Undertaking paid employment or a student job is subject to very strict regulations (a work permit is compulsory for students who are not from the European Union). By the same token, current legislation does not allow students to finance their studies by student jobs alone. More information is available at the federal website ‘Studentatwork’.

					<p>
						<a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/livres-et-materiel.html">UCLouvain's web page</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						The annual cost of books, course materials and office supplies varies, depending on course choice and year, between €400 and €700.
						<br>
						In addition, first-year bachelor’s degree students should anticipate additional set-up costs of approximately €100 (lab coat, testing equipment, etc.), plus the cost of purchasing a computer, which on average is €600.
						<br>
						A student’s subsequent years of study entail specific internship and dissertation costs.
						Here’s a tip
						<br>
						Some costs may be reduced. Consult reference works at the faculty library or website in order to find second-hand books and course materials.

					</p>
					<p>
						To calculate a complete budget, students must consider the cost of food and other necessary items that are not specific to studying.
						<br>
						Food costs for a student living in UCL housing are slightly higher than those for a student living in the family home.
						<br>
						Generally, students take breakfast in their student or other on- or near-site housing, at the family home, at a café, etc.
						<br>
						Lunch can be taken at University Restaurants, which offer several complete meal options, including a vegetarian menu, at very reasonable prices.
						<br>
						There are also many private restaurant options in town, as well as supermarkets and take-out and delivery options.
						<br>
						Generally, students should budget a minimum of €50 per week (not including the weekend) for food.
						Tips
						<br>
						University restaurants offer a main dish for as low as €3.20.
						<br>
						Many students get together to prepare their meals, thus reducing costs and maximising a sense of community.

				<li id="housing"><b>Housing costs</b>
					<p>
						<a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/logement.html">UCLouvain's web page</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						UCL offers housing at competitive prices. Monthly rent for basic student housing (excluding electricity) varies between €240 and €340, and requires a security deposit of between €150 et €???.
						<br>
						First-year bachelor’s degree students have priority for UCL housing.
						<br>
						Students of more modest means can apply for rent reduction (of €55 or €75/month) in accordance with certain academic and economic criteria. New students must apply to the Student Support Service (Service d’aide aux étudiants) no later than 1 July.
						<br>
						Property agencies and private owners also offer housing, whose prices vary greatly.
						<br>
						Complete information is available at the UCL Student Logistics and Housing Service.

						<br>
						Both Louvain-la-Neuve and Brussels are rich in possibilities for cultural appreciation and entertainment. It is up to each student to take advantage of them during their time at UCL.

							    HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO STUDY AT UCL?
							    <br>
								UCLouvain is a private university, but it is subsidised by public authorities, which is why it is affordable.

						<p>
							Freedom of religion and separation of church and state are guaranteed by the Belgian Constitution. Belgium’s religious tradition is Catholic, although Protestant churches, mosques, synagogues and temples are found in most cities. About 65% of the population is Christian, of which 58% are Catholic. Members of Protestant, Eastern Orthodox churches and other Christian denominations make up 7%. Muslims account for about 5%. About 27% are agnostic or atheist. Practitioners of Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism have a small presence.

						<p>
						    DOES UCLOUVAIN ADMIT ONLY CATHOLICS OR CHRISTIANS?
						    <br>
							No. Students of many religions attend UCLouvain, and no religious involvement is required.

							Religion / Spirituality
							<br>
							While the ‘C’ stands for ‘Catholic’, UCL, with its more than 120 nationalities, includes just about every creed, secular or religious, practising or not. Students, researchers, faculty and staff are Muslims, Jews, Protestants and other Christians (including Catholics), Buddhists, Hindus, atheists, agnostics and other persons who would describe themselves in any number of ways.
							<br>
							Louvain-la-Neuve is home to a mosque and Islamic cultural centre as well as a Protestant church. Brussels Woluwe hosts an ecumenical centre.
