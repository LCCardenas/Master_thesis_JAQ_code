						Libraries
						<br>
						The UCL staff card or the UCL student access card entitles its holder to free access and borrowing privileges at all UCL libraries and learning commons.
						<br>
						UCL libraries hold 1.5 million books and 3,500 current paper journals, in addition to the resources located in research laboratories and specialised centres with subject-specific source documents.
						<br>
						UCL libraries offer access through their portal to more than 30,000 e-journals from all the major scientific publishers, as well as 80,000 e-books and some 100 bibliographical and factual databases, such as Bloomberg/Macrobond, Scopus and SciFinder. Paper and electronic resources are easily accessible on site as well as off-site through the Libellule library portal. In addition, Discovery helps users browse and search, via a single interface, all UCL print and digital holdings, databases and external references.
						<br>
						In addition, UCL offers DIAL (Digital Access to Libraries), a digital consultation and long-term storage tool for UCL and partner institution research publications. Digital versions of all research publications are definitively stored, and their online promotion and dissemination is assured. The institutional repository is flexible enough to host heterogeneous content and allow varied access and use. The main purpose of DIAL is offering the full publication text, not just bibliographic references.
						<br>
						Need help? Ninety trained librarians are on hand to help users in their reference work and literature search.

						Student activities
						<br>
						The university encourages student involvement in extracurricular activities, whether social, sport, environmental or cultural, and provides venues, equipment and subsidies. Student associations have formed around four types of activities:
						<br>
						    Student representation is assured by the Louvain Student General Assembly (AGL) at the university level; student offices at the faculty level; and the General Coordination of International Students (CGEI).
						    An original idea that involves students sharing a flat and working together on a social, cultural or sport-related project in which they have a special interest, the so-called ‘kots à projet’ are home to nearly a thousand students each year.
						    Regional organisations (‘Les Régionales’) reunite students of the same geographical region and promote their local folklore on campus.
						    Faculty groups (‘Les Cercles’) bring together students of the same faculty.
