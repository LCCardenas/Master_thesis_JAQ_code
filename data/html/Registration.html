					<p><i>Note: this is actually explained in study organization.</i></p>
					<p>
						Before the start of the semester
						<br>
						Learning Agreement 
						<br>
						Your choice of courses must respect your home university requirements and the LSM rules.
						<br>
						Please use the LSM Learning Agreement template.
						If needed, we can also sign another template that you send us by email.
						<br>
						If you are thinking of learning French, you can mention "French Course" without the course code in your Learning Agreement. You have the possibility to do a language test to evaluate your level of French when arriving in Belgium and thus select the course(s) you need.
						<br>
						LSM recommends a workload of 30 ECTS credits for one semester. The below ECTS rules are of application :
						<br>
						    The maximum workload per semester at LSM is 30 ECTS.
						    Regular exchange students minimum workload is 20 ECTS (besides language courses).
						    CEMS exchange students minimum workload is 25 ECTS (besides Block Seminar, seminars & language courses).
						    <br>
						Note that this choice is not final as you have the opportunity to test the courses you selected during the two first weeks of the semester. You will be able to change your choice of courses and make a final decision.
						During the two first weeks of the semester
						<br>
						This is the time to confirm your courses choice made in your Learning Agreement or modify it using an appendix (called the Annex) to the initial Learning Agreement.
						<br>
						The choice of courses made through your ECTS learning agreement can be modified during the first two weeks of the semester with the approval of your home university and LSM.
						<br>
						When you want to modify your courses initially selected and when your courses choice is final, you must fill-in the Annex to the Learning Agreement and hand it over to the LSM Incoming Coordinator. The deadline is the second Friday following the start of the semester. The LSM Incoming Students Coordinator will register you for all the courses you selected.
						<br>
						ECTS rules:
						<br>
						    The maximum workload at LSM is 30 ECTS.
						    Regular exchange students may take less than 20 ECTS besides language courses. An email from the home coordinator is needed to confirm this low workload is agreed.
						    CEMS exchange students need a minimum of 25 ECTS besides Block Seminar, seminars and language courses.
						    <br>
						Courses Organisation
						<br>
						Most professors use Moodle to organise their courses.
						<br>
						Your registration on Moodle is not an official registration but only an information platform used for communication between students and Professors.
						Final step to be registered correctly
						<br>
						Check your Registration
						<br>
						After the deadline to submit your Learning Agreement (or its Annex), we will finalize your registration to courses.
						<br>
						You will be asked to check your courses registration on "MyUCL" on your UCLouvain account. The exact code and title of courses must appear. If there is any discrepancies with your final courses choices, you should inform the LSM Incoming Students Coordinator without delay.
						<br>
						Remember that, if this course registration is not correct, it will not be possible to make any changes during the semester.
						<br>
						Be aware of the issues this can raise :
						<br>
						    If a course you want to follow is not listed on "MyUCL", it will not appear on your Transcript of Records and no grade will be given for it
						    If a course you do not want to follow stays on "MyUCL", it will appear on your Transcript of Records with the mention "NE" meaning "Not Evaluated"
						    <br>
						Moodle
						<br>
						Moodle is a distance course information platform used by the professors to give students information, exercises, documents and communication tools regarding their courses. Professors will inform students if they use this tool during their first lecture.
						<br>
						Your registration on Moodle is not an official registration. To access Moodle you must be registered as a UCLouvain student and have your UCLouvain account activated.
						<br>
						Create your Moodle user account by going on https://moodleucl.uclouvain.be/. 
						<br>
						You will then have to possibility search for the course using the course code in order to find your lecture notes or any other document the professor has posted there for you.

							    HOW DO I ENROL AT UCLOUVAIN?
							    <br>
								First, if you are NOT a national of a European Union country, you have to complete the UCLouvain online application form by 30 April; if you ARE a national of a European Union country, the online application deadline is 31 August. When your online application is complete and your accompanying documents are received, your file will be assessed and, if it is approved, the Enrolment Office will send you a registration authorisation. This assessment takes several weeks. Exception: if you are a national of a European Union country and hold a Belgian degree, you can bypass the application procedure and register directly online. More information.

								2a.Enrol at the University
								Bachelor’s and master’s students
								<br>
								Bachelor’s and master’s students must enrol in two places, in the following order:
								<br>
								1. Enrol at the university
								<br>
								You must confirm your admission by following the instructions indicated in the admission letter you have received at home. The procedure varies depending your situation. If the admission letter instructs to register at the Enrolment Office, you must bring your signed and dated admission letter and all required documents: diplomas, transcripts, passport, study visa (ASP), financing plan and proof of financial support. However, if the file is judged to already be complete, you may only be asked to send your dated and signed admission letter to validate your enrolment. During validation of your enrolment, you will have the opportunity to sign up for sport and fitness activities and for the Culture Card and the Solidarity Card.
								<br>
								Upon enrolment you will receive by post:
								<br>
								    a tuition fee invoice;
								    a provisional student card (which is confirmation of your enrolment);
								    a public transport certificate.
								    <br>
								After paying the tuition fee invoice, you will receive by post your definitive UCL student card, which grants you access to libraries, sport centres, and certain buildings and to obtain discounts in certain shops and cinemas.
								<br>
								You will also receive in your virtual office the following certificates:
								<br>
								    a certificate that allows you to join a health insurance agency (a ‘mutuelle');
								    a certificate proving you are a student, for submission to the municipality (‘Administration communale’ or simply ‘commune’, located in the town hall) in which you reside;
								    a family allowance certificate, if relevant.
								    <br>
								From the moment of your enrolment at UCL, you are covered for physical accidents that may happen within the strict framework of your academic activities.
								<br>
								Please note the enrolment deadline is 30 September.
								<br>
								More information at the Enrolment Office.
								<br>
								2. Enrol in your faculty
								<br>
								Go to the office of your faculty secretary to complete a faculty enrolment form, which must be submitted by the end of the second week of classes.
								<br>
								Please note: Late enrolment – after 30 September – requires written faculty authorisation.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/s-inscrire-0.html">UCLouvain's web page</a>
							<p>
								As an international student, you must complete the Enrolment Office online application form. If you are applying for a master’s programme, your dossier will be assessed by a faculty jury. You must submit your application by the deadline. Online application opens in December.

								Immigration / Visa
								<br>
								For students, researchers and lecturers who are staying for more than three months:
								<br>
								    citizens of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway or Switzerland do not need a visa.
								    citizens of any other country have to apply for a visa at the home country’s Belgian embassy or consulate as soon as possible.
								    <br>
								Regardless of nationality, individuals who are staying for more than three months are required to register with the municipality (‘Administration communale’, often spoken of simply as the ‘commune’) of residence within eight days of arrival in Belgium. This registration is valid for one year (five years for EU nationals) and must be resubmitted for renewal one month prior to its expiration (details below under ‘When you arrive’).
								<br>
								Researchers and lecturers employed by UCL may also require a Belgian work permit (see ‘Work permit’ below).
								<br>
								More information is available at the home country’s Belgian embassy or consulate, the Belgian Immigration Office and the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
