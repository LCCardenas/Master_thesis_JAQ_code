								Student support
								<br>
								The university cares about its students. This includes physical health and psychological well-being in every context: the classroom, the laboratory, accommodation, social life.
								<br>
								Whenever students encounter difficulties that hinder their studies or personal life, they should contact the university’s Student Support Service. Dedicated teams of some 50 professionals – social workers, doctors, psychologists and nurses – are ready to help. Whatever difficulty they may be experiencing, they can ask any question or confide any problem. For example:
								<br>
								    Finding it difficult to adapt to student life?
								    Having trouble financing studies?
								    Dealing with a disability that requires specific support?
								    Questioning choice of studies or educational direction?
								    Experiencing family, relationship, flatmate or personal difficulties?
								    Suffering from a health, stress, diet, sleep, alcohol, drug, mood, sexual or any other issue?
								    <br>
								Students should not hesitate to contact the Student Support Service.
							</p>
							<p>
								Persons with disabilities
								<br>
								UCL is committed to supporting persons with disabilities to pursue their higher education dreams.
								<br>
								Any UCL student with a disability, severe illness or learning disorder can apply for the status of a ‘Student with a specific profile’, or, using the French acronym, ‘PEPS’ status. PEPS status assists students with disabilities to pursue an academic programme of study with all the necessary support, including what’s most important: an inclusive environment. Academic demands and degree value are identical to those of any other UCL student, but learning and daily living arrangements, such as accommodation, are adapted not only to meet the student’s specific needs but to help the student thrive. (PEPS status also applies to high-level athletes, artists and entrepreneurs.)
								<br>
								The 'Aide Handi Unit’, part of UCL’s Student Support Office, supports students with a disability. Students can make an appointment with a social worker, who will help answer all their questions about everyday life. A psychologist also coordinates educational support.
								<br>
								Aide Handi professionals inform disabled persons about specific services, organise welcome events and educational assistance, and provide information on study choices, ensuring that tailor-made teaching aids are supplied and helping the student gradually acquire a working method that meets academic requirements. They can also provide information about financing studies and discuss health-related challenges.
