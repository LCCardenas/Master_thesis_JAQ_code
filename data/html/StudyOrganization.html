					<p>
						Register to Courses
 						<br>
						Before the start of the semester
						<br>
						Learning Agreement 
						<br>
						Your choice of courses must respect your home university requirements and the LSM rules.
						<br>
						Please use the LSM Learning Agreement template.
						If needed, we can also sign another template that you send us by email.
						<br>
						If you are thinking of learning French, you can mention "French Course" without the course code in your Learning Agreement. You have the possibility to do a language test to evaluate your level of French when arriving in Belgium and thus select the course(s) you need.
						<br>
						LSM recommends a workload of 30 ECTS credits for one semester. The below ECTS rules are of application :
						<br>
						    The maximum workload per semester at LSM is 30 ECTS.
						    Regular exchange students minimum workload is 20 ECTS (besides language courses).
						    CEMS exchange students minimum workload is 25 ECTS (besides Block Seminar, seminars & language courses).
						    <br>
						Note that this choice is not final as you have the opportunity to test the courses you selected during the two first weeks of the semester. You will be able to change your choice of courses and make a final decision.
						During the two first weeks of the semester
						<br>
						This is the time to confirm your courses choice made in your Learning Agreement or modify it using an appendix (called the Annex) to the initial Learning Agreement.
						<br>
						The choice of courses made through your ECTS learning agreement can be modified during the first two weeks of the semester with the approval of your home university and LSM.
						<br>
						When you want to modify your courses initially selected and when your courses choice is final, you must fill-in the Annex to the Learning Agreement and hand it over to the LSM Incoming Coordinator. The deadline is the second Friday following the start of the semester. The LSM Incoming Students Coordinator will register you for all the courses you selected.
						<br>
						ECTS rules:
						<br>
						    The maximum workload at LSM is 30 ECTS.
						    Regular exchange students may take less than 20 ECTS besides language courses. An email from the home coordinator is needed to confirm this low workload is agreed.
						    CEMS exchange students need a minimum of 25 ECTS besides Block Seminar, seminars and language courses.
						    <br>
						Courses Organisation
						<br>
						Most professors use Moodle to organise their courses.
						<br>
						Your registration on Moodle is not an official registration but only an information platform used for communication between students and Professors.
						Final step to be registered correctly
						<br>
						Check your Registration
						<br>
						After the deadline to submit your Learning Agreement (or its Annex), we will finalize your registration to courses.
						<br>
						You will be asked to check your courses registration on "MyUCL" on your UCLouvain account. The exact code and title of courses must appear. If there is any discrepancies with your final courses choices, you should inform the LSM Incoming Students Coordinator without delay.
						<br>
						Remember that, if this course registration is not correct, it will not be possible to make any changes during the semester.
						<br>
						Be aware of the issues this can raise :
						<br>
						    If a course you want to follow is not listed on "MyUCL", it will not appear on your Transcript of Records and no grade will be given for it
						    If a course you do not want to follow stays on "MyUCL", it will appear on your Transcript of Records with the mention "NE" meaning "Not Evaluated"
