						Moodle
						<br>
						Moodle is a distance course information platform used by the professors to give students information, exercises, documents and communication tools regarding their courses. Professors will inform students if they use this tool during their first lecture.
						<br>
						Your registration on Moodle is not an official registration. To access Moodle you must be registered as a UCLouvain student and have your UCLouvain account activated.
						<br>
						Create your Moodle user account by going on https://moodleucl.uclouvain.be/. 
						<br>
						You will then have to possibility search for the course using the course code in order to find your lecture notes or any other document the professor has posted there for you.
