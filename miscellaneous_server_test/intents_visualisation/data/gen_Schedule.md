The 3rd one is only to resit exams that you failed or didn't pass.<br><br>There is a week of holidays at the end of January (after the exams) and 2 weeks during the Easter break in April or May. There are also no lectures in the summer from July to mid-September.<br><br>You can find more precise calendars on <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/calendrier-academique-0.html">this web page</a>.

A quadrimester is divided in 2 parts, sometimes separated by a few weeks of holidays or an evaluation week. Some courses are given during only one part of the term, while others are given during a whole term or a whole year.<br><br>A quadrimester ends with an exam session. Don't worry, you will always have a few weeks between the last lectures and the first exams to let you study.
