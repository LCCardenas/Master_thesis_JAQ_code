~[&which] identity papers are necessary?
You do not need a visa if you are a national of one of the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway or Switzerland. If you do need a visa, the Enrolment Office will provide you with a registration authorisation letter to add to the student visa application you submit to your Belgian embassy or consulate. In either case, all students must register with their commune of residence within eight days of arrival in Belgium. <a href="http://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/travel_to_belgium/visa_for_belgium">Complete information on Belgian visas</a>.

~[&can I] {take/have} French classes at ~[UCL]?
Is it possible to have classes in French?
Of course! (If you’re an ‘Erasmus+’ exchange student, you can even get a head start on improving your French before your programme begins, by taking online classes on the OLS platform – see next answer below). Intensive preparatory courses are offered to international students prior to the start of the academic year. After that, you can take classes at the UCL Language Institute (<i>Institut des langues vivantes, ILV</i>) or improve your French via student organisations offering learning activities such as conversation groups, knowledge exchange, text correction, etc. <a  href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/apprendre-les-langues.html">Complete information on learning languages at UCL.</a>

This support is available for the duration of your stay at UCL. <a href="http://erasmusplusols.eu/">More information about OLS.</a>

{Do [&i]/~[should I]} need to buy health {insurance/coverage}?

In Belgium, all students must have health insurance.

If you are not a European Union national, you must join a mutual insurance company (€100-120/year) upon your arrival in Belgium and present proof of this coverage to register at UCL.

What about insurance [coverage?]?
In Belgium, all students must have health insurance. If you are a national of a European Union country or of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland, consider requesting your European Health Insurance Card, provided free of charge and allowing you to access the same health care available to Belgians. If you are not a European Union national, you must join a mutual insurance company (€100-120/year) upon your arrival in Belgium and present proof of this coverage to register at UCL. <br> In principle, your home university should continue to insure you against accidents and civil liability during academic activities. Please contact your university to learn about the terms of its insurance policies. If it does not provide insurance for you, as a registered UCL student you receive ‘accident’ coverage (including during transport between your housing and the university, study trips, internships) and ‘civil liability’ coverage for academic activities. Please be advised that there is no ‘accident assistance’ component for accidents that take place in Belgium (e.g. repatriation to your home country in case of accident).
