<p><p>Choosing your courses and other learning activities must be done in close consultation with your academic tutor at the home university. Whether you are looking for equivalent or complementary courses, the overall objective should be the coherence of the study period at UCLouvain with the degree programme at your home university.</p><p><a  href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/le-catalogue-de-formations.html">All the courses available at UCLouvain</a> are published on the website. Both the individual course descriptions as well as the details on Bachelor and Master degrees are available in French and English. There are various ways to gain access to this rich source of information:</p><ul type="circle"><li>if you know the title of the course, or if you wish to search for it by key words, you can use the course description search engine;</li><li>alternatively, and to approach the course description in the context of the UCLouvain degree programme of which it forms part, you can consult the UCLouvain study programme.</li></ul><p>When making a choice, you should pay careful attention to certain practical points listed in the course description, such as the year(s), the semester(s) and the language of instruction.</p><p>As soon as your application has been accepted by your home university, please do not hesitate to contact <a  href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/les-coordonnateurs-de-mobilite-a-l-ucl.html">the UCLouvain faculty exchange coordinator</a> for help and advice.</p></p>

What are ~[ECTS] [for?]?
What is the purpose of ~[ECTS]?
How many ~[ECTS] are there in a {year/quadrimester/quadrimestre/week}?
<p><p>ECTS credits are workload units to build your programme. They reflect the amount of work necessary to pass a particular learning activity (e.g. a course or a seminar) and are calculated taking into account the total time needed in order to achieve the desired learning outcomes, including the time spent in individual study.</p><p>Being a standard European measure, ECTS credits will make it easier for your studies at UCLouvain to be recognized by your home university.</p><p>A standard academic year is equivalent to 60 ECTS credits. Depending on how long you will stay at UCLouvain, you must therefore, in general, make up a programme of 30 credits (one semester) or 60 credits (two semesters). The exact number of credits you need to take is set by your home university, depending on your individual learning path. However, at UCLouvain you will be expected to make up a programme sufficiently close to the workload of a typical full-time academic semester or year.</p></p>

When is the ~[learning agreement] {made/signed [up?]} ?
What is {the role of?} the ~[learning agreement] ?
What is the ~[learning agreement] [used?] for?
<p><p>When your courses have been choosen a Learning agreement will be drawn up. This document lists the learning activities to be followed and the credits to be achieved upon satisfactory completion of the course assessments. In general, the learning agreement is first validated by your home university and then forwarded to the host faculty at UCLouvain. Agreed by all three parties, it is your guarantee that the activities which you complete satisfactorily during your stay at UCLouvain will be fully recognized by your home university.</p><p>The Learning agreement is <u>the</u> reference document for managing your programme; all exchange students are entitled to expect that it is signed before they leave for UCLouvain. Normally, the Learning agreement is put at your disposal by your home university. In particular, for countries participating to the Erasmus programme, the <a _fcksavedurl="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/opportunities/higher-education/doc/learning-studies_en.pdf" href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/opportunities/higher-education/doc/learning-studies_en.pdf">European model</a> is mandatory.</p></p>

<p><p>UCLouvain uses a single ECTS grading table, taking into account the grades obtained in all programmes during the last five academic years. The decision to use one single ECTS grading table was based on the extremely low differences observed between faculties, as was made evident in the statistical analysis of a large sample of grades (1.040.645 in total between 2010-2015). In addition, the single ECTS grading table allows for clear communication, both with students and partner institutions.</p><p>Every year the grading scale is reviewed.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#eaf2fa" width="35%"> <strong>Grade</strong></td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">19</td><td align="center">18</td><td align="center">17</td><td align="center">16</td><td align="center">15</td><td align="center">14</td><td align="center">13</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">11</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center"><10</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#eaf2fa" width="35%"><p> <strong>% of students awarded the grade</strong></p></td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">1.8</td><td align="center">4.7</td><td align="center">7.8</td><td align="center">12.0</td><td align="center">14.1</td><td align="center">15.0</td><td align="center">13.6</td><td align="center">11.9</td><td align="center">9.9</td><td align="center">8.9</td><td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#eaf2fa" width="35%"> <strong>ECTS Grade</strong></td><td align="center" colspan="4">A</td><td align="center" colspan="2">B</td><td align="center" colspan="2">C</td><td align="center" colspan="2">D</td><td align="center">E</td><td align="center">F</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Institutional Co-ordinator for Erasmus and Student mobility : Prof. Dominique De Jaeger</p><p>Contact: M. <a href="mailto:bart.stoffels@uclouvain.be">Bart Stoffels</a>,<a _fcksavedurl="mailto:erasmus@uclouvain.be" href="mailto:erasmus@uclouvain.be"> </a>International Office, Place de l'Université 1,B-1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, BELGIUM</p><p>For any matter related to courses, ECTS credits and the Learning Agreement, students should contact <a  href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/les-coordonnateurs-de-mobilite-a-l-ucl.html">the student exchange coordinator of their faculty</a>.</p></p>

[&can I] have some general {information/informations} about the Master [cycle?]?
What is {the/a} master ?
<p><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Completion of this 60- or 120-credit programme (180 for medicine), typically over two years (three for medicine), earns the student a master’s degree.</p><p>Eligibility to pursue a master’s degree is based on prior completion of 180 course credits. Holders of an <em>haute école</em> (non-university higher education institution) bachelor’s degree can become eligible by completing bridge courses, while more experienced individuals who are ‘going back to school’ can turn to the Validation of Acquired Experience (VAE) process.</p><p>Two types of master’s programme exist: 120-credit and 60-credit. UCL offers 93 120-credit master’s programmes (with 181 available foci) and 33 60-credit master’s programmes.</p><p>A master’s programme is a process of knowledge specialisation and in-depth study. It enables the student to gain deeper insights and, by choosing a focus, to acquire the necessary skills and expertise to pursue a professional career, teach or conduct research.</p><ul><li>Master’s programme bridge courses. Recipients of an <em>haute école</em> bachelor’s degree can become eligible to apply for a master’s programme via the system of bridge courses. A French Community of Belgium decree determines a) the master’s programmes for which applicants are eligible based on degrees already obtained and b) any admission conditions (for example, on the condition of first earning additional credit). If you’re already a UCL student and wish to pursue a master’s in a field that differs from your bachelor’s, you may be able to do so by means of programme adaptation and any transferable credits.<br>	 </li><li>Most UCL master’s programmes include internship possibilities (teaching, clinical, professional, research). Such immersion in professional life will help the student learn about the world of work, develop new skills and directly participate in his or her socio-professional integration. Other channels of socio-professional integration include recruitment preparation workshops and career planning support, the latter at both university and faculty levels (consult the Information and Orientation Centre).<br>	 </li><li>Another UCL advantage is its emphasis on learning languages throughout the master’s programme, which will empower the student to achieve genuine multicultural and professional integration. UCL also offers several programmes taught entirely in English.<br>	 </li><li>International mobility and discovering other academic environments are integral parts of a UCL education. UCL has agreements with over 400 institutions in Flanders, Europe and the rest of the world. These agreements allow as many students as possible to live abroad during their studies within the framework of exchanges and joint degree programmes.<br>	 </li><li>Finally, students with a specific profile (athletes; artists; entrepreneurs; students with a disability, serious illness or disorder) can take advantage of a particular status (part of the ‘Programme for Students with a Specific Profile’, French acronym ‘<em>PEPS</em>’) that allows for special arrangements in their university curriculum.</li></ul><p> </p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><a  href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study-programme/masters-by-field-of-study-2017.html">UCL Master's programmes 2017-2018</a><br> </h2></div>source: <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/study/masters.html">https://uclouvain.be/en/study/masters.html</a></p>

What is an internship ?
What are internships?
What does internship mean?
<p><p>An internship is an opportunity for a student to work in a company or organisation in conditions similar to those of the employees who work there. The objective is to gain social and professional skills and learn about the technical, social and economic aspects of the job. The internship also fuels motivation and imparts essential qualities such as organisation, adaptability, initiative, responsibility and affability.</p><p>When it takes place as part of the student’s studies, the internship is an apprenticeship in documentary research and academic writing that calls on the student’s abilities to analyse, think critically and summarise.</p></p>
