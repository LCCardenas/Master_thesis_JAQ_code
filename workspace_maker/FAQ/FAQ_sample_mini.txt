How do I obtain a student visa for Belgium?
I wanna have a visa for Belgium, how can I do ?
You do not need a visa if you are a national of one of the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway or Switzerland. If you do need a visa, the Enrolment Office will provide you with a registration authorisation letter to add to the student visa application you submit to your Belgian embassy or consulate. In either case, all students must register with their commune of residence within eight days of arrival in Belgium. <a href="http://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/travel_to_belgium/visa_for_belgium">Complete information on Belgian visas</a>.

#calendar
What is the academic calendar?
How is the year going?
The academic year is divided into two terms. The first begins mid-September and ends mid-December and is followed by an exam period in the first three weeks of January. The second term begins at the start of February and ends mid-May and is interrupted by the two-week Easter holiday. It is followed by an exam period in June. A third exam period takes place from mid-August to early September during which students can retake exams whose initial results were unsatisfactory. <a href="//uclouvain.be/en/study/calendrier-academique-0.html">Consult the UCL academic calendar.</a>
